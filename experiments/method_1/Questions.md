# Questions

1. How is linear scan performance affected by using user-level batching /
   buffering to avoid system calls?

2. Is linear scan performance difference mostly in branch misprediction?

3. How much performance does the heap cause?

4. Easy way to overlap further IO and computation?

5. Can this overlap or lack of overlap be easily captured as part of a
   benchmarking tool / feedback?
