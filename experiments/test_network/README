A test script for bandwidth and latency test on EC2
===================================================

To run the test, we need to:
(1) edit the configration in "config.py",
(2) launch a set of servers within a placement group, by another script or
manualy through web interface,
(3) run "test_network.py" with the given placement group name.

The script will build scripts, copy them to every machine, run them, and
collect results.

Dependency:
Iperf and rsync needs to be installed on every machine.

Potential bug:
The script assumes that launching script through ssh happens immediately, if it
is not the case, the script might not work well. It is generally fine.
