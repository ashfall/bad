Several simple programs are included, used to test basic disk IO performance.

read: read a file in serial.
write: write a file in serial.
random_read: read a file in random.
random_write: write a file in random.
async_read: read a file in serial, but implemented with kernel AIO interface.
async_read_random: read a file in random, but implemented with kernel AIO interface.

The following commands are used to test raw disk performance:
sudo dd if=/dev/xvdb of=/dev/null bs=1M count=10240
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/xvdb bs=1M count=10240

Command to format the file system.
sudo mke2fs -t ext4 -O ^has_journal /dev/xvdb
